Why Participate?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rapidly growing Python audience
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Python is growing fast in the Philippines. Last year, we had a record of over
200 Pythonistas attend PyCon, ranging from complete beginners to experts. By
speaking at PyCon, you can become part of the rising Python culture.

A celebration of Python
"""""""""""""""""""""""

PyCon is a celebration of the Python language and every year, we gather speakers
that will honor and showcase the language.

Driving forward as a Python Pioneer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Speaking to a large audience is hard work. But in exchange, you'll gain
reputation amongst your peers as a credible Python speaker.

You will also help establish Python's reputation in the Philippines. Who knows,
maybe one of your peers would become surprised that you are a Python pioneers.

Friendly community
""""""""""""""""""

Python.Ph have only hosted two PyCon. However, you'll find a friendly core of
participants who always seem to return. So we are probably doing something
right. These people are also unbelievably nice, as evidenced by all the smiles
in our photos.

Our community is so friendly, that passionate and enthusiastic newcomers become
even more passionate and enthusiastic with Python. They have started spreading
the Python around.

As a speaker, you will have a chance to talk in front of the charming PyCon
participants.

Learning experience
"""""""""""""""""""

It is not everyday that you will have a chance to speak to over 200 people from 
all around the Philippines and the World. You will make mistakes. You will
be pressured. Your audience will react. And you will learn something new and
become a better speaker. 

Speaker benefits
""""""""""""""""

As a speaker, you will be invited to dinner with other speakers, the PyCon
volunteers, and the organizers. This will be great time to rest up, network, meet
new friends, and most important of all: *eat... for free!*

Speaker Presentation submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our theme this year is *"Work and Play with Python"*. Your presentation should be
structured around this theme.

If you would like to give a presentation, you can `submit your proposal here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SVFXq6yH4uzkeZ4510CL13Oa5q3KKQpC4sXflu2S_5c/viewform>`_

The deadline for submission of presentations will be on May 15, 2015.

Workshops
^^^^^^^^^

We also hold workshops during PyCon Philippines. We traditionally have two
workshops: Beginner Python and Django. Both of these workshops lasts 4 hours.

This year, we would like to add three new workshops: Practical Python, 
Advanced Python, and Sprints. Do you have the knowledge and expertise to
host a workshop?

Practical Python
""""""""""""""""

The objective of this workshop is to train the participants in using Python
in a practical manner. The trainer should be able to encourage the people
to use Python more often.

Expert Python
""""""""""""""""

The objective of this workshop is to push the participant's knowledge into
expert territory. No time is used in discussing the basics.

Sprints
""""""""""""""""

The objective of this workshop is to make something useful. Whether this is
to add to documentation or to fix bugs, participants should come out of this
workshop with a feeling of accomplishment.
