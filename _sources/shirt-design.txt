Shirt Design Contest
====================

Get the chance to design PyCon PH 2015's shirts! We're holding a design contest
starting May 21 (Thursday). You can submit entries until May 27 (Wednesday)
11:59 PM. We'll then open up voting until June 3 (Wednesday) 11:59 PM.

Submission
----------

Submit entries by sending an email to shirt-design@python.ph
Subject should be your complete name. Your design file should
be an attachment. Max file size is 10mb. File format should be
in PNG, PSD, SVG or AI.

We will exclude entries that are offensive or unrelated.

Voting
------

Entries are automatically collated into a Trello board.
We'll open up the entries list for voting on May 27. Voters
will need to sign up to Trello. It's a nice free tool anyways ;)

On June 3, voting will be closed and the top 3 entries
will be selected. The organizers will then vote and choose
among these 3 entries.

Ownership
---------

Upon submission, design becomes a property of Python.PH, Inc.
We're doing this to allow us to sell shirts without
any legal impediments. We won't say we made it ourselves.
You'll still be credited for your work.
