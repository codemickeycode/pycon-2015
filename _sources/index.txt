PyCon Philippines
=================

PyCon Philippines is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit conference centered around
the Python Programming language.

The main goal of this conference is to provide a venue where the Python
programming language and surrounding technologies can be explored, discussed and
exercised.

We have an interest to gather software engineers, programming enthusiasts, 
startup founders, corporate IT decision makers, students and IT educators in a 
2-day event where we can collaborate and learn with each other.
