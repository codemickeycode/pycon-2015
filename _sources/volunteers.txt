Call for Volunteers
-------------------

PyCon Philippines is ran by volunteers. The previous PyCons would not have been
successful without the help of these individuals. This year will not be different.

We have many roles that need to be filled to make PyCon PH 2015 awesome. Being a
volunteer is hard work but they will be rewarded with:

 - Free PyCon PH 2015 tickets
 - Free dinner on the first day with the speakers
 - Special and limited-run PyCon PH 2015 Volunteer T-shirt
 - PyCon PH 2015 volunteer's certificate
