Theme
=====

This year, our theme will be **"Work and Play with Python"**.

There are many reasons to use Python. On this coming July 4-5, 2015, 
we will be exploring the ideas of using these concepts in Python.

**At work**. Python has been used to make scripts to assist the 
workflow and to make commercial applications. 

**At play**. Python has been used to scratch the creative itch 
and to have fun.
